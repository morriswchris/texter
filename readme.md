# Texter

Quickly open up an editor in the language of your choice

## But How?

Once installed, Texter allows you to utilize the Chrome Omnibox (the search bar) to quickly open a new [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/#nav=about) editor window. To begin simply type `text` followed by hitting `tab`. This will bring up the Texter language search. Specify the language you desire, and press enter. Voila, a new editor right in your chrome browser.
